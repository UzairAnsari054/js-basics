<!-- Default Js is a Synchronous language which means it is single threaded & that means code will be executed one after another sequentially & that means each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing. 

Kernel: A kernel is a fundamental component of an operating system that facilitates communication between software and hardware. 
Queue: Enter first, Exit first
Stack: Enter first, Exit last


File read krna is an long and heavy process,
& apka program nhi read kr sakta toh apko apne program ka context dena pdta apne OS ke kernel ko,
kernel file read krta h aur apke context ko laakr info deta h.

Sync Vs Async
Accha yaa bura kch nhi hota, har cheez ka use case hota h
1. File Read krna, is use case me, Async (non-blocking) programmin better h. Ke jab tak KernelJi file read nhi kar lete, ExecutionBhaiSahab app apna kaam continue kro.
2. Writing user info in DB, is use case me, Syan (blocking) programmin better h. Ke jab tak KernelJi DB me user ka data store nhi kar dete, ExecutionBhaiSahab app apna kaam band kro.

Steps in Async programming:
1. A callback function is registered to handle the asynchronous task
2. The registered tasks are added to the task queue/callback queue
3. The tasks/callbacks from the task/callback queue is picked from the queue and gets pushed into the callStack for execution
In the newly added fetch() api, their's a keyword 'Promise' which basically works the same as callback but it just creates a seperate queue that contains the task which are given more priority
Eg,
Log(1) ==> Print 1
Log(0,2) ==> Print 2 but after 0 second
Log(3) ==> Print 3
Result will be [1,3,2] because even is the time interval is 0 seconds but it still will register a callback function, which will be added to a queue & then will be added into the callStack for execution, by that time 3 will be printed   -->

<!-- handler, callback are just functions that don't have names -->

<!-- setTimeout(2000) // => will execute after  2 seconds
setInterval(2000) // => will execute after every 2 seconds -->

<!-- JS just contains CallStack & Memory
setTimeout(), clearTimeout(), clearInterval() are not core functions of JS, you get them through browser -->
